# Questions and Solutions

In teaching material it is common to want to include questions (and possibly solutions) to the reader.  It is possible to use [custom blocks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html) to achieve distinct styling, however this doesn't provide internal labelling, referencing and numbering.   **bookdown** doesn't current provide an environment for questions and answers, although one can manipulate the various "[theorems](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#theorems)" to achieve something similar.

## Questions

You can include a question using the inline function `r knitr::inline_expr("msmbstyle::question()")`.  This takes two arguments: `text` and `label`.  `text` is a character string and provides the body of the question.  `label` is optional, and if provided can be used to reference the label in the main text of the book. Labels for questions must start with the string '*ques:*'

The following question is produced by `r knitr::inline_expr("msmbstyle::question(text = \"Does this look like a question?\")")`

`r msmbstyle::question(text = "Does this look like a question?")`

We can produce a numbered question like Question \@ref(ques:numbered) using something like `r knitr::inline_expr('msmbstyle::question(text = "Is this question numbered?", label = "ques:numbered")')`

`r msmbstyle::question(text = "Is this question numbered?", label = "ques:numbered")`

### Including `"code"` in a question.

In order to include text formated to look like R code in you can use the sequence '`\x60`' to represent the backticks inside the text argument e.g.

`r msmbstyle::question(text = "Does this question include \x60x\x60 and \x60y\x60?")`

## Solutions

You can insert solutions using either the function `r knitr::inline_expr("msmbstyle::solution()")`, or a combination of `r knitr::inline_expr("msmbstyle::solution_begin()")` & `r knitr::inline_expr("msmbstyle::solution_end()")`  

### Simple solution - `solution()`

If your solution is simply a paragraph of text, you can use `msmbstyle::solution()` and provide the paragraph via the argument `text`.  We see an example of this approach below:

```{r, simple-solution} 
msmbstyle::solution(text = "This is a single paragraph providing the answer to a question.")
```

Additional arguments to this function are `begin` and `toggle` argument.  The first of these allows you to set the text that begins a solution e.g. if you would rather they were called 'answers'.  The `toggle` argument expects a logical which if set to `TRUE` will create the solution in a 'collapsed' format, which can be seen above.  Pressing the plus icon will then show the content of the solution.  This gives the option of initially hiding a solution, so the reader is forced into taking an active step to reveal the answer.

### More complex solutions - `solution_begin()` / `solution_end`

If you need to provide more detail than a single paragraph in a solution, you can use the functions `solution_begin()` and `solution_end()` to demark the content of the document you wish to be included in the solution.  (*This is similar to using `\begin{}` and `\end{}` tags in a Latex document.*).

It is perhaps simplest to call the functions inline within your R Markdown document e.g. `` `r knitr::inline_expr("msmbstyle::solution_begin()")` ``, and they must be used as a pair, otherwise the resulting document will have missmatched HTML tags.

The example below shows a solution that involves several paragraphs of text, along with a code block and the output created by running this code.  This is all contained within our 'collapsed' solution environment and can be revealed by clicking on the plus symbol.

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

This is a more comprehensive answer.  It involves both this text, some code, and the plot produced by that code.

```{r, longer-solution}
plot( 1:10 )
```

The plot above is great!

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`
